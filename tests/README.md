### General Info

In this folder  you will find every files required to run:
- unit tests (using CMocka)

- memory tests (using Valgrind)

A script is provided to run all of those tests.

## Get started

```bash
chmod +x run_tests
```

#### Unit Tests
During the script, chose ```u``` to launch unit tests via the ```CMakeList.txt```.

CMocka software will be temporary downloaded from [source repository](https://git.cryptomilk.org/projects/cmocka.git). This may take a while.

In the end, a log file named ```unitreport-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.log``` will be placed in ```tests/```.

#### Coverage test
During the script, chose ```c``` to launch coverage and memory tests.

Elements needed will be compiled by the ```Makefile```.

HTML coverage report will be created in ```tests/coverage/```.

#### Memory check
During the script, chose ```m``` to launch coverage and memory tests.

Memory leaks report will be created in ```tests/memreport-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.log```.
